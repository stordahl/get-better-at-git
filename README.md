# The Perfect Commit

- Create commits that 'make sense'
- Make commits as small as possible, commiting only changes that are related
- Do not batch all local changes into one commit!!!
- Smaller commits are easier to understand
- For staging partials use `git add -p <filename>`
- Commit messages
  - Subject should be concise
  - Body should be more verbose and detailed
  - Commit message body should answer
    - What is different than before?
    - What is the reason for the change?
    - Is there anything that others should watch out for in this commit?
